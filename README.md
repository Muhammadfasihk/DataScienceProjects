# StackOverflow Developer's Survey Analysis

This Python Notebook contains an analysis of the StackOverflow Developer's Survey. It explores the answers to the following questions.

•	How to break into the field?
•	Are respondents with higher formal education biased towards their own degrees?
•	Are bootcamps worth it?
•	How do different data attributes affect Job Satisfaction?

I have used the following libraires in the project:
•	import numpy as np
•	import pandas as pd
•	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; plt.rcdefaults()
•	import missingno as msno
•	from collections import defaultdict
•	from IPython import display
•	from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
•	from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
•	from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error
•	import seaborn as sns
•	%matplotlib inline
•	from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
•	from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso
•	from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet
